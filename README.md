# project-2-visitor-system

The purpose of this application is to apply nodejs, express and vanilla javascript and perform simple operations on a database, MongoDB cloud in this case.

This app was build using the template from this demo: https://github.com/prsaya/node-express-mongodb-html-demo-1

This simple web application is made out of 2 html pages: the sign in page and the visitor system page

The sign in page contains 2 fields: user = Stephane and password = abc

Then after logging in, the app is redirected to the system page

The page contains 3 buttons (add, delete and clear), 2 fields (name and age) and a table.

After filling out the visitor's name and age, click the "add" button to save the data into the table.

To remove an entry from the table, navigate and click on the entry to be deleted, then click the "delete" button.

The clear button serves to clear a selection from the table and empty the fields from entries it might contain.
